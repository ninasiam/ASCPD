FOR GOOD CONDITION NUMBER
-WE know the direction of gradient (see contour lines)
Thus, we can use it to take a good stochastic direction.

check the error and window scheme

to do: check which stochastic gradients are good

We observed that when we have oscillations (around the optimum maybe) (often in small condition number) we had to adapt the window scheme in order to decrease the stepsize
However in larger condition numbers, we observed that we had a plateau (very slow decrease of cost function) thus an adaptation for a larger stepsize should be implemented.
