Katyusha initial implemetation.
Katyusha paper
Proximal paper Tibshirani

Katyusha vs SVRG (see katyusha vol 3)
	-same scheme as SVRG for full gradient
	-no proximal term, so different update for x_hat
	-seems that katyusha outperformes SVRG
Also, a quick look on Bottou pg.68

->30/8/2019<-
Also compare the SG with the rest ->done
Put sotchastic nesterov on the game ->done

->2/9/2019<-

Experiment with vatious step sizes for SG -> ended up with a constant that resembles the calcultion of L.

Begin bubeck's book.

Read the lectures of Shmidt for SGD.
 

->3/9/2019<-

Right now katyusha and svrg closes with error

TOmorrow set the number of iterations as in SGD and NSGD

-12/9/2019<-

changed the stopping conditions
